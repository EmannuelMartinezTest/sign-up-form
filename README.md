# Sign-Up Form Project!
A live implementation of the project can be found at this [GitHub Pages Link](https://emannuelmartineztest.github.io/sign-up-form/).

## Initial Goals
The idea of a sign-up form is a lot simpler than its implementation. Here are a few things I had to think about throughout
the project, as well as overall goals I had going into it.

- Validate all of our fields in our sign-up form using an appropriate pattern
- Display appropriate error messages whenever mal-formatted data is entered
- Make the webpage responsive
- Come up with a fun design

The hardest part of a sign-up form is always keeping track of the state of the form as a whole in relation to 
the other fields. Up to this point, we had been used to atomic level functions, where one part of the program was either
like a light switch, where it either was on or off always, or the functions didn't really have to worry about what the other
functions were doing. 

So using a pseudo-state management system throughout made it an interesting, but fun challenge overall.
